# Team-Awesome-Project-1

###Introduction

The intent of this project was to help practice the skills we've been building up until now, to learn what it's like to work as a team, and to push ourselves to research/build skills that weren't learned in class. The aim of our project create a mapping website using Google's mapping APIs in conjunction with Yelp's surprisingly useful API. To make it simple we have a search bar and six business type options. The user searches a city then they can choose business types. The Yelp API finds the 5 top rated businesses in the selected area of the selected category. The original plan was to then be able to be able to make a routing plan to optimize your day.

###Technologies

Bootstrap 4, JQuery, local storage, Google Places API, Google Maps API, Yelp API, and Love <3

####Setup

Search a city to begin with then choose categories.

###Features

-Ease of use

-Marker clustering

-Geolocation via the Yelp API

-Local storage of the previous 8 searches

####Features we'd like to add

-Routing!!

-Hover over windows displaying business info of the select marker

-Having the ability to choose the locations you want to go to. The idea is you pick a category, choose one of the options. The map would then reorient to the that map marker. You then choose another category, pick a business, map reorients again and so on.

-Firebase to have the ability to sign in and have the history be available on any machine.
